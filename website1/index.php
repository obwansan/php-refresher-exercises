<?php include('inc/header.php');  ?>

    <h1>Home</h1>

<?php include 'inc/footer.php';  ?>

<!-- 
  Use include if you want the script to continue even if the file can't be included.

  Use require if you want the script to fail if the file can't be included. 
  
  require_once is the same as require but won't require the file again if it's been 
  required already (saves memeory? CPU?)
